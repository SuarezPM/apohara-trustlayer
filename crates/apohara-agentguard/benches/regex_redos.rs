//! ReDoS guard: feed pathological inputs to the firewall and assert the scan
//! stays bounded AND scales linearly.
//!
//! The Rust `regex` crate is linear-time by construction (no backtracking), so
//! catastrophic backtracking is impossible — this is a regression guard that
//! confirms no two-stage post-validator (or future change) reintroduces
//! super-linear behavior on adversarial inputs.
//!
//! Two checks per input class:
//! 1. Absolute bound: a single scan of a ~2 KB adversarial input stays under a
//!    generous wall-clock cap (the engine's compiled regexes are warmed up
//!    first so one-time `LazyLock` compilation is excluded from the timing).
//! 2. Linearity: a 4x larger input must take well under 16x the time. A
//!    quadratic blowup would fail this even if the absolute timing flaked; this
//!    is the real ReDoS signal and is robust to scheduling jitter.
//!
//! Registered as a `harness = false` bench so it runs as a plain binary under
//! both `cargo test` and `cargo bench`. Sizes are realistic-but-stressful: 2 KB
//! is already far larger than a typical prompt; the firewall is linear so even
//! tens of KB stay in the low-millisecond range in release.
