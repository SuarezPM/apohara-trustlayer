//! Doc-sync regression net: the README "Now caught (v0.1.x)" / "Still out of
//! scope" lists must not drift ahead of the pinning reality in
//! `tests/gate_evasions.rs`. This is a REAL test (not `#[ignore]`d): a README
//! that claims an evasion is closed while `gate_evasions.rs` still pins it
//! Allow — or vice versa — fails the build.
//!
//! It is deliberately ROBUST to formatting: it works on lowercased substrings /
//! keywords and on the actual gate verdict, not on exact line text, so cosmetic
//! edits don't make it brittle. Each closed evasion is verified THREE ways:
//!   1. the README "Now caught" section names it (keyword present),
//!   2. `gate_evasions.rs` has a `*_blocks` pin for it (no `is_not_caught`),
//!   3. the LIVE gate actually Blocks the canonical sample.
//!
//! Each out-of-scope item is verified TWO ways: named in the "Still out of
//! scope" section, and NOT present in the "Now caught" section.
