/// agents perform routinely; only the recursive/force `rm -rf` form (which can
/// wipe trees and is the actual destructive pattern) is dangerous. The
/// `rm-rf` taxonomy rule deliberately requires the recursive+force flag combo,
/// so a bare `rm file.txt` does not match. Warning on every `rm` would train
/// users to ignore the gate (alert fatigue). The MUST-NOT-Block requirement
