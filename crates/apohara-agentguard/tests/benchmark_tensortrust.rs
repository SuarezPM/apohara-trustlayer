//! External benchmark: the input firewall vs. REAL human-written prompt-injection
//! attacks from the Tensor Trust dataset (BSD-2-Clause; see
//! `tests/corpus/tensortrust/{LICENSE,PROVENANCE.md}`).
//!
//! Why this exists: the in-repo `benchmark.rs` corpus is author-curated, so it
//! can be (unconsciously) tuned to what the gate already catches. This benchmark
//! is the honest counterweight — 400 attacks WE DID NOT WRITE, from a published
//! adversarial-ML dataset, scanned with the production firewall entry point
//! `firewall::scan_content`.
//!
//! What it MEASURES (not a hard 0-FN gate): how many of those human attacks the
//! firewall does NOT flag (false negatives). On the BLOCK-capable surfaces
//! (Read/WebFetch/WebSearch), `scan_content` returning anything other than a
//! `Block` means the attack would slip through — so an attack is counted as a
//! false negative iff its verdict tier is NOT `Block`. (A `Warn` still passes the
//! content through, so it is a miss for this purpose.)
//!
//! The FN count is PUBLISHED to stdout (run with `--nocapture`). The only
//! assertion is a generous, documented sanity ceiling so a future regression that
//! silently zeroes out the firewall fails the build — it is NOT tuned to the
//! measured value. We do not yet claim a target FN rate on human attacks;
//! measuring it honestly is the entire point of this story (US-D).
