//! Fuzz target hardening the gate's core soundness claim ("parser-bounded").
//!
//! It drives arbitrary bytes through the exact pipeline the live hook uses —
//! `normalize_command` -> `split_compound` -> `gate::evaluate` — and enforces
//! two invariants:
//!
//! * **INVARIANT 1 (implicit, primary): the gate never panics / never hangs.**
//!   libfuzzer reports any panic as a crash and has its own timeout, so simply
//!   exercising the functions on adversarial UTF-8 proves the never-abort
//!   contract that "parser-bounded" rests on. This is the load-bearing check.
//!
//! * **INVARIANT 2 (explicit, conservative): a real `rm -rf <path>` leg is
//!   never Allowed.** Asserting this on *arbitrary* input would produce
//!   spurious crashes (most random bytes are benign and correctly Allowed), so
//!   the check is deliberately constructed: we splice a known-dangerous
//!   `rm -rf <suffix>` leg onto the fuzzer-derived bytes as its own top-level
//!   leg. The gate is contracted to surface a destructive `rm -rf` against a
//!   path, so for this constructed input it MUST NOT return `Allow`. This
//!   hardens the destructive-leg-surfacing claim without false positives.
